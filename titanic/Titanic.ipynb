    "This is my first Data Science challenge and although there are many great notebooks that allow you to reach very high scores (83% or higher) I tried to develop my own workflow, picking advices from the discussion forum and implementing some meaningful steps to reach a decent score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all the notebooks that I read, I found very useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  [Zlatan Kremonic - Titanic Random Forest: 82.78%](https://www.kaggle.com/zlatankr/titanic-random-forest-82-78/notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "-  [Pedro Marcelino - Data analysis and feature extraction with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/data-analysis-and-feature-extraction-with-python/notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "They both give a nice and smooth explanation especially about the exploratory analysis which is easy to follow even for a beginner like I am. Keep in mind that these are just 2 of the hundreds you can find in the forum and most of them are equally valuable. Comments and answers to notebooks are another rich source of knowledge that it is worth to spend some time on ([Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte) is one of the most active in this sense).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notebook you will reach 0.81818 which is Top 5% at the time of writing by using simple Logistic Regression and little feature engineering. One of the key steps that allowed me to make a jump in the score was a correction in the dataset that I made when I grouped all the passengers by family, as you will see later down in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course any comment or suggestion is more than welcome, thank you!"

Remember: here classes are represented as integers (1, 2, 3) and the PCC being negative is simply telling us that the higher the class (the integer, not from a social point of view) the lower the chances of survival, which of course makes sense and is consistent with the \"survival rate vs class\" plot I have shown at the beginning. But we can go ahead in the analysis: that plot also shows us that there is NOT obvious difference between 1st and 2nd class passengers. Biggest gap is between children's survival rate but it's not correlated with the concept of class itself since it's much higher for 2nd class children. I thought that this aspect might be misleading for the algorithm and decided to transform <b><i>Pclass</i></b> into a categorical feature, as we will see later.\n",

The only important thing was whether the passenger was a child or not. For the rest, passengers of age 20, 30, 50 or whatever they were all treated in the same way (we are not interested here in passenger's sex or class). This is the reason why the PCC is failing at this specific task. In this new scenario, we need to slightly modify the feature <b><i>Age</i></b> and make it binary.
